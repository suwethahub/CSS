<h3>About</h3>
<p>The American College, often referred to as American College, is one of the oldest colleges in India, located in Madurai, Tamil Nadu. It was founded in 1881 by American Christian missionaries. The red-brick buildings, in the Saracenic style, blend with the natural surroundings constructed by British architect Henry Irwin. Century-old buildings Main Hall, James Hall and Washburn Hall show the heritage of the college.</p>
